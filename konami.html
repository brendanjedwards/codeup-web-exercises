//NOTE TO SELF: Ideal Objectives, if possible within reason...
    //Make it possible for the screen to be able to detect physical "key-input".
    //Set a time limit to the delay-time between button-presses, reset if unable.
    //Insert a "trigger" in the html to cause a reaction to a successful entry.
    //Have the "reaction" do something- ie, show a new screen, play music and/or video, etc.
    //The overall experience should have a degree of old-school Nintendo aesthetic.
